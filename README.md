# Jets Project

### Description

This is a program designed to give the user a simple interface menu in which they can choose between several options. The premise of this application is based around a fleet of jets, which the user can view (there is default set of 5 jets that are implemented into the fleet when the program runs), change by adding or removing a jet, or interacting with the jets in the fleet by calling on methods that display more information such as the length of time the jets could theoretically fly based on there range and top speed. The jets all consist of variables that make up there type, model name, top speed, range and price. 

### Techs used

This program utilizes an abstract base class that extends the other subclasses that make up the specific types of jets. Their are also interfaces that correlate with those subclasses. On top of that one of the most important aspects to this entire project is a class called airfield, which uses an Array list to hold and organize the various jets of the fleet. The array list allows for there to jets added and removed to the fleet with ease and without having to worry about the size of a predetermined array. I then used a few methods within the airfield class to allow the program to sort through the Array and do things like add or remove a new jet or find the jet with the highest speed using for loops.


### Takeaways
This project helped to solidify some of the topics we have covered in the past week of class. I found it to be really good practice and I also enjoyed deciding what jets I was going to use and then looking up some of their real world attributes.
